# Alternative coverage generation using pytest-xdist
# This distributes tests across multiple processes, reducing memory per process

# Install: pip install pytest-xdist coverage

# Run with limited workers to control memory:
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=selve --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing -n 2

# Options:
# -n 2         : Use 2 worker processes (adjust based on available RAM)
# -n auto      : Use all available CPUs (may cause RAM issues)
# --maxfail=5  : Stop after 5 failures to save resources
